# Satellite Orbit Prediction using Machine Learning (Starlink)

**Team Members:**

## Problem Statement
Thousands of satellites orbit Earth, and their positions constantly change due to:
- Atmospheric drag  
- Gravitational forces  
- Orbital maneuvers  

This makes predicting their next position challenging.

Accurate orbit prediction helps prevent:
- Satellite collisions  
- Communication signal loss  
- Mission planning failures  

## Our Solution
We use **Machine Learning (Random Forest)** and **LSTM Deep Learning** to predict the **next orbital position** of a Starlink satellite using its historical orbit data.

## Technologies Used
| Purpose | Tools Used |
|--------|------------|
| Programming | Python |
| Data Handling | pandas, numpy |
| Visualization | matplotlib, seaborn |
| Machine Learning | scikit-learn |
| Deep Learning | tensorflow, keras |
| Development Environment | Jupyter Notebook |


## How to Run the Project
1. Install **Python 3.8+**
2. Open **Command Prompt / Terminal**
3. Go inside the project folder
4. Install required dependencies:

5. Start Jupyter Notebook:

6. Open:

7. Run all cells to see:
- Data preprocessing  
- Model training  
- Prediction output  

## Result
The **LSTM model** predicts the next orbital position more accurately compared to Random Forest.

## Future Scope
- Live satellite tracking using real-time API data  
- Web dashboard for visualization  
- Multi-satellite prediction system
